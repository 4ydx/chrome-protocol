# About chrome-protocol

A relatively thin wrapper on top of code that is generated based on
the chrome devtool protocol.  Aims to provide a few of the basic commands that
one would desire when automating actions in chrome or any other browser that
supports the protocol.

# Examples

Examples of basic actions are included in the example folder.

- Navigation
- Focus
- Fill
- Click

I will be working on other actions as I need them for my own personal projects.

Navigation example:

```
package main

import (
	"github.com/4ydx/chrome-protocol"
	"github.com/4ydx/chrome-protocol/actions/enable"
	"github.com/4ydx/chrome-protocol/actions/page"
	"log"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	frame := cdp.Start()

	// Enable page events 
	if err := enable.Page(frame, time.Second*2); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Navigate
	if err := page.Navigate(frame, "https://google.com", time.Second*5); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	log.Printf("\n-- All completed for %s --\n", frame.FrameID)

	cdp.Stop()
}
```

# Creating your own Actions

Actions are the requests that you make to the browser in order to automate different tasks.  For instance asking
the browser to navigate to a particular url.  When you construct an action you need to fill in at least one "step" that consists
of the params struct, the reply struct, and the method name of the API call you are making.  Finally it is possible to associate events
that the server will send to the client with your action.

Please refer to example/navigate and look at the internals of the method calls for a basic example.  
This shows an action that consists of a single step and depends on certain navigation events being fulfilled before the action is considered complete.

API methods, events, and types are all defined in the [Devtools Reference](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot).

# Caveats

Currently there is no code for opening a browser.  There is a start.sh script that shows how to manually start a browser.  
The code will then create a websocket connection for you.

Once a connection is made, you should only run actions against that "frame" in a serial manner.  I haven't tested concurrent access.
It should work, but I cannot guarantee it at the moment.
